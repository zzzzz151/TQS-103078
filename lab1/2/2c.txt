The functions with low coverage are fromArray(int[]), hashCode(), size(), intersects(BoundedSetOfNaturals).
They all have 0% coverage.
Only the functions iterator(), contains(integer), BoundedSetOfNaturals(int), add(int[]) had all possible branches covered.

What kind of unit test are worth writing for proper validation of BoundedSetOfNaturals?
Unit tests for add(int), add(int[]), fromArray(int[]), size(), intersects(BoundedSetOfNaturals), contains().
